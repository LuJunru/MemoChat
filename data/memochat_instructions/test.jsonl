They have such an easy life. They don't even pay for drinks when they go to a cocktail party.\n(line 24) bot: Show biz stars have plenty of expenses. That's why they need so much money. They need million of dollars to buy big, seclude houses and wonderful dresses. I bet most show biz stars would prefer to wear jeans and a t-shirt, but they can't because their managers force them to wear clothes they don't like.\n(line 25) user: I don't understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars. They're overpaid, over-ambitious, and over-adored.\n(line 26) bot: I think you should give them some credit. They're very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn. They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves.\n(line 27) user: Come on!
